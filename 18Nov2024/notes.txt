To create Package.json file we need use "npm init " command 
package.json file contain information of dependency in a project.
parcel is a bundler. bundler means it will combine all the files and it will generate one single file.
TO install parcel we need to run " npm i -D parcel " i - stands for install
the MOment run npm i parcel command  it will install node_modules folder and it will also install package-lock.json file
node_modules folder contain all the dependencies.
package-lock.json will lock the file with all installed all the dependencies versions.

-D - means devdependencies it means dependencies which we need in development
dependencies - means it will used in development and production environment.
npm - No Abbreviation for NPM but earlier it use to call it as " Node Package Manager"
URL for NPM = https://www.npmjs.com/
NPM helps us to download the dependencies in the project.

To run Project " npx parcel index.html" 

"devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.13.0", // parcel bundler dependencies 
    "process": "^0.11.10"
  },

  ^ - caret symbol it denotes that it will automatically update the minor version
  ~ tilde version it denotes that it will automatically update the major version

Difference between caret / tilde in package .json file.

if we use react CDN links it will hit the URL which is quite expensive in terms of network call

<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

instead of that we can download the dependencies in our local machine with the help of NPM


import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

we need React because we can create web Application and mobile Application
We need ReactDOM only while working with Web Application
