In the Index.js file we have written the following
const headOne = <h1 id ="headOne"> HeadOne </h1>;
the above code is not an HTML but it is JSX .
JSX stands for Javascript for XML it looks like HTML but at the end it is Javascript.
JSX at the end is converted to React.createElement("")

const headTwo= <div>
<h1> headingOne inside h1Tag</h1>
<h2> HeadingTwo Inside h2 Tag</h2>
<p> Paragraph Tag inside P Tag </p>
</div>

// already we are targeting the <div id = "root"> is top most parent 
and inside we have created an extra div which has 3 kids i.e. h1, h2 and p tag.
so in order to avoid the extra div tag
we can use the empty <> </>
so that there will be only one div parent tag
and it will have 3 kids

the empty tags are called as "React.Fragment"

Important Note:

In JSX, if we are writing the multiple tags
then it must contain a parent tag
