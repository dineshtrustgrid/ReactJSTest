JSX Expression 
if we need to display javascript code with JSX then we need to display javascript with curly braces {}
this curly brace is known as JSX Expression 

at the end JSX will be converted to React.createElement() and React.createElement() will be converted to javascript

important Note:
JSX will be converted to React.createElement() by Babel 
Babel is a transcompiler 
the moment we install parcel bundler with help of npm i -D parcel command automatically it installs Babel .
