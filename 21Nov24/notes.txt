const printDetails = <h1 className="info">user ID is {userID} and username is {userName}</h1>; // JSX 
what Babel does it converts JSX to React.createElement()
const printDetails = React.createElement("h1" , {className:"info"},"user ID is", userID ,"and username is", userName)

const printDetails = { 
    type = "h1",
} 

JSX attributes will be written in CamelCase.
FOR example :

class will be written as className 
background-color will written as backgroundColor

In JSX expression if we use HTML attribute ,we will get an error
